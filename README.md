It was developed as a capstone project for the Bachelor's degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP and later re-structured for public publishing.
The initial version was presented and published @RECPAD 2022, and a short paper can be found [here](http://mobilecardriving.papers.filipepcampos.com/).
